Installation
============

Installation is pretty straightforward, but the extension is useless on its own. It must be
installed as part of the Tesseract project.

The only condition is that “phpdisplay” must be installed **before** “displaycontroller”.


.. _installation-compatibility:

Compatibility
-------------

As of version 2.0.0, TYPO3 CMS 7 LTS or more is required.
