The "phpdisplay" extension is a Data Consumer for the Tesseract framework. It is used to display and
format data given to him by the controller. PHP Display is well indicated when dealing with complex
layout by offering the flexibility of the PHP language. It is also targeting developers who prefer
to deal with PHP template. For small needs or for people who are not very familiar with PHP, the
"templatedisplay" extension would be probably more appropriate.
